# minimalist_whackamole

A minimalist design of whackamole

## Getting Started

This is a simple interface created to improve my understanding of the Flutter framework. It primarily deals GridView, simple state management, and customizing basic attributes. Very simple.

The original intent was to create a game for my toddler son. He enjoys "playing aliens" (which is what he calls this game) by tapping on them to hide/show them.

## Key Features:
- A 4 x 5 grid Android icons is populated
- Each Android icon is randomized to be shown or to be hidden on initial app-load
- User can toggle show/hide each Android icon by tapping
